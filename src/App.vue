        <p class="text-danger">Completing the square</p>
        <p>We can complete the square to solve a Quadratic Equation (find where it is equal to zero).</p>

        <p>But a general Quadratic Equation can have a coefficient of <strong>a</strong> in front of x<sup>2</sup>:<p>

        <p> <strong>ax<sup>2</sup>+bx+c=0</strong></p>

        <p>But that is easy to deal with ... just divide the whole equation by "a" first, then carry on:</p>

        <p><strong>x<sup>2</sup> + (b/a)x + c/a = 0</strong><p>

        <p class="text-primary">Steps</p>

        <p>Now we can solve a quadratic equaton in 5 steps:</p>

        <p>
            <strong>. Step 1</strong> Divide all terms by <strong>a</strong>(the coffient of x<sup>2</sup>)<br />
            <strong>. Step 2</strong> Move the number term (<strong>c/a</strong>) to the right side of the equation.<br />
            <strong>. Step 3</strong> Complete the square on the left side of the equation and
            balance this by adding the same value to the right side of the
            equation.
        </p>

        <p>We now have something that looks like (x + p)<sup>2</sup> = q, which can be solved rather easily:<p>

        <p><strong>. Step 4</strong>Take the square root on both sides of the equation.</p>
        <p>
            <strong>. Step 5</strong>Subtract the number that remains on the left side of the
            equation to find <strong>x</strong>.
